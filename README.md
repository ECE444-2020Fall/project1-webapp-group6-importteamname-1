# Chef Co-Pilot 

This web application asks a user to enter ingredients, and then recommends recipes based on the ingredients. The user can
add recipes to favourites list, rate recipes, save personal notes on recipes, and add recipes to a cart to generate an ingredients shopping list. The ingredients shopping list contains a list of additional ingredients that the user needs to purchase in order to prepare the carted recipes.
